          <p>
            <br />
            I'm Rezha, a full stack web developer, with express on the backend,
            and react on front end (mern stack) from Surabaya, Indonesia.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've finished my bachelor of political science from University of
            Brawijaya, currently working as a sales executive at a freight
            forwarding industry.
            <br />
            <br />
            I learned the basics of computer scinece on June 2023, through CS50
            - Harvard's Introductory to Computer Science.
            <br />
            <br />
            I got my MERN stack skill on The Odin Project, starting from July
            2023. I speed through it, and finished it on December 2023.

          <h2>hello</h2>

            <br />
            I'm Rezha, self-taught full stack web developer from Surabaya,
            Indonesia.
            <br />
            <br />Before being a programmer, I've finished my bachelor of
            political science from University of Brawijaya, worked as a sales
            executive at a freight forwarding industry.
            <br />
            <br />Then i feel the need to have an expertise on a certain
            technical skill, and i chose programming. hoping to contribute to
            that world while mastering my craft.
            <br />
            <br />I started this path on June 2023, through CS50 - Harvard's
            Introductory to Computer Science. I learned the basics of Computer
            Science, as well a touch of full stack web dev with python as my
            final project submission.
            <br />
            <br />Then I go to The Odin Project, starting from July 2023. i
            speed through it, and consider myself finished with it on December
            2023.
            <br />
            <br />Now, i am a full stack web developer, with express on the
            backend, and React on front end (mern stack).But i am aware of other
            stacks and technologies, and are always eager and open to new
            challenges thrown at me.
